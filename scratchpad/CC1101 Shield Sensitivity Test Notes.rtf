I evaluated two CC1101EM shield boards:\
\
1. CC1101Adapter_V1_00 - First shield, no ground planes or bypass capacitors. Compatible with CC1101 only (can't supply current for version with TX booster).\
\
2. CC1101-1190EM_Adapter_V1_00 - Second shield, has ground planes and bypass capacitors on each Arduino pin that is used. Also has a power supply regulator to accommodate a CC1101 board with TX booster.\
\
Shield 1:\
\
Antenna with small ground plane connected with 6" pigtail:\
\
RSSI averaged as power over 16 samples at 135MHz: -102 dBm\
With antenna directly attached to CC1101 board connector: -95 dBm \
\
Shield 2:\
\
No by-pass caps\
Antenna with small ground plane connected with 6" pigtail:\
\
RSSI averaged as power over 16 samples at 135MHz: -105 dBm\
With antenna directly attached to CC1101 board connector: -101 dBm \
\
Similar results with by-pass caps.\
